# [FLY] Freelance System: Core
This tool allows a user to manage permissions to access their SAGE Labs game. The tool interacts with the Player Profiles system created by Star Atlas to add and remove permissions related to SAGE Labs.

### Terminology
**Handler Account** – This account controls permissions. This should be the Solana account which holds assets (ships, resources, etc).

**SAGE Game** – The specific instance of SAGE associated with the Handler Account. Think of this as the “game save” for SAGE.

**Lancer Account** – This account is granted permissions by the Handler Account to interact with the Handler Account's SAGE Game.
* A Lancer Account is allowed to use the “game save” of the Handler Account.
* The Lancer Account does not interact directly with the Handler Account, and no permissions are granted outside of those related to the SAGE Game.
* The Lancer Account does not have permissions to transfer assets from the Handler Account.
* The Lancer Account does not have permissions to give other accounts access to the Handler Account.

## Use Cases
### Freelance System
This enables the core functionality necessary for a Freelance System. A Handler who owns assets can enlist the help of a Lancer to operate fleets while maintaining full control over their assets. Typically, the Handler and Lancer would establish an agreement for profit sharing or payment to compensate the Lancer for their time and effort.

### Secure Auto-approval
Permissions can be granted to a "hot wallet" (the Lancer Account) while maintaining all assets in a hardware wallet (the Handler Account). The hot wallet cannot withdraw or transfer assets from the hardware wallet, so there is inherently less risk involved when enabling auto-approval for hot wallet transactions. The hot wallet can then be used in conjunction with SLY's Lab Assistant to carry out SAGE Labs activities.
